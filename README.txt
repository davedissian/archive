An archive of older personal projects.

* **celestial-engine** - A Direct3D 11 engine written in October 2010 written for fun to learn D3D11.
* **ic-gamejam-2014** - Entry to the Imperial College GameDev Soc GameJam in late Feb 2014 (theme: reincarnation). A physics puzzle game where the player can take command out of inanimate objects.
* **ic-gamejam-2015** - Entry to the Imperial College GameDev Soc GameJam in early March 2015 (theme: trains). A tower defense game where you have to destroy incoming trains. The player can select from many different towers including lasers, rocket launchers and electric bolt towers.
* **iggcm-2016* - Entry to the Imperial GameDev Game Creation Month competition spanning Feb 2016 (theme: procedural generation). Aim was to build an RTS game, but I ended up writing an OpenGL renderer with a basic scene graph, before I had to dedicate time towards my thesis project.
* **ludumdare28* - Entry to the 28th Ludum Dare competition in late Dec 2013 (theme: you only have one). A rogue-like 2D space shooter inspired by RayStorm on the PS1.
* **rubikscube-comp4* - My final project for AQA A2 Computing, where I had built a Rubiks Cube simulator in C# with multithreaded rendering, and a command interface.
* **velocity-engine** - A Direct3D 9 engine written in June/July 2010. Includes a resource cache implementation, font rendering and a scene graph.
